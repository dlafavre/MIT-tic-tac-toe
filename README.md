# Future Improvements
There are a couple of improvements I'd like to make. One feature could be to add a timer to each turn, so that players have a limited amount of time to make their move. Another feature could be to add a "best of" option, where players can choose to play a series of games and the winner is the first player to win a certain number of games.

To implement the timer feature, you could use the setTimeout function to limit the amount of time a player has to make their move. If the player doesn't make a move within the allotted time, their turn is skipped.

To implement the "best of" feature, you could add a new option to the game menu that allows players to choose how many games they want to play. You could then keep track of the number of games won by each player and declare the winner once one player has won the specified number of games.
